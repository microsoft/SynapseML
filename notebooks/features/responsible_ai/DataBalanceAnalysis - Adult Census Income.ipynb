    "\n",
    "In this example, we will conduct Data Balance Analysis (which consists on running three groups of measures) on the Adult Census Income dataset to determine how well features and feature values are represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used to predict whether annual income exceeds $50,000/year or not based on demographic data from the 1994 U.S. Census. The dataset we're reading contains 32,561 rows and 14 columns/features.\n",

    "Data Balance Analysis consists of a combination of three groups of measures: Feature Balance Measures, Distribution Balance Measures, and Aggregate Balance Measures.\n",
    "In summary, Data Balance Analysis, when used as a step for building ML models, has the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It reduces costs of ML building through the early identification of data representation gaps that prompt data scientists to seek mitigation steps (such as collecting more data, following a specific sampling mechanism, creating synthetic data, and so on) before proceeding to train their models.\n",
    "* It enables easy end-to-end debugging of ML systems in combination with the [RAI Toolbox](https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai/responsible-ai-toolbox-capabilities/) by providing a clear view of model-related issues versus data-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Throughout the course of this sample notebook, we have:\n",
    "1. Chosen \"Race\" and \"Sex\" as columns of interest in the Adult Census Income dataset.\n",
    "2. Done preliminary analysis on our dataset. \n",
    "3. Ran the 3 groups of measures that compose our **Data Balance Analysis**:\n",
    "  * **Feature Balance Measures**\n",
    "    * Calculated Feature Balance Measures to see that the highest Statistical Parity is in \"Sex\": Males see >50k income much more than Females.\n",
    "    * Visualized Statistical Parity of Races to see that Asian-Pac-Islander sees >50k income much more than Other, in addition to other race combinations.\n",
    "  * **Distribution Balance Measures** \n",
    "    * Calculated Distribution Balance Measures to see that \"Sex\" is much closer to a perfectly balanced distribution than \"Race\".\n",
    "    * Visualized various distribution balance measures to compare their values for \"Race\" and \"Sex\".\n",
    "  * **Aggregate Balance Measures**\n",
    "    * Calculated Aggregate Balance Measures to see that we need to forego 77.79% of data points to have a perfectly balanced dataset. We identified that our dataset is leaning towards maximum inequality, and we should take actionable steps to:\n",
    "    * Upsample data points where the feature value is barely observed.\n",
    "    * Downsample data points where the feature value is observed much more than others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In conclusion:**\n",
    "* These measures provide an indicator of disparity on the data, allowing for users to explore potential mitigations before proceeding to train. \n",
    "* Users can use these measures to set thresholds on their level of \"tolerance\" for data representation.\n",
    "* Production pipelines can use these measures as baseline for models that require frequent retraining on new data. \n",
    "* These measures can also be saved as key metadata for the model/service built and added as part of model cards or transparency notes helping drive overall accountability for the ML service built and its performance across different demographics or sensitive attributes."
