Having a well balanced data representation is critical when developing models in a responsible way, specially in terms of fairness. \n","It is unfortunately all too easy to build an ML model that produces biased results for subsets of an overall population, by training or testing the model on biased ground truth data. There are multiple case studies of biased models assisting in granting loans, healthcare, recruitment opportunities and many other decision making tasks. In most of these examples, the data from which these models are trained was the common issue. These findings emphasize how important it is for model creators and auditors to analyze data balance: to measure training data across sub-populations and ensure the data has good coverage and a balanced representation of labels across sensitive categories and category combinations, and to check that test data is representative of the target population.\n","\n","In summary, Data Balance Analysis, used as a step for building ML models has the following benefits:\n","* <b>Reduces risks for unbalanced models (facilitate service fairness) and reduces costs of ML building</b> by identifying early on data representation gaps that prompt data scientists to seek mitigation steps (collect more data, follow a specific sampling mechanism, create synthetic data, etc.) before proceeding to train their models. \n","* <b>Enables easy e2e debugging of ML systems </b> in combination with [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) by providing a clear view if for an unbalanced model the issue is tied to the data or the model. \n","\n","---\n","\n","Note: If you are running this notebook in a Spark environment such as Azure Synapse or Databricks, then you can easily visualize the imbalance measures using the built-in plotting features.\n","\n","Python dependencies:\n","- matplotlib==3.4.2\n","- numpy==1.19"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a51d55f3-8f47-47e6-8698-4b78e65f034d","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import pyspark.sql.functions as F"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"5c7332a8-b256-4c57-a593-ab338f7ca623","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["df = spark.read.parquet(\"wasbs://publicwasb@mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/AdultCensusIncome.parquet\")\n","display(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"267c342b-2770-4dff-aae3-aa75af24adef","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Convert the \"income\" column from {<=50K, >50K} to {0, 1} to represent our binary classification label column\n","label_col = \"income\"\n","df = df.withColumn(label_col, F.when(F.col(label_col).contains(\"<=50K\"), F.lit(0)).otherwise(F.lit(1)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"5af3f65c-5f1b-4e11-9bc9-ffa2b00116ae","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["### Perform preliminary analysis on columns of interest"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"819cb707-a3fd-45c0-a3d9-96e54d4a7e6f","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["display(df.groupBy(\"race\").count())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"dd78d2b8-fefa-458b-bc23-629f7e763414","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["display(df.groupBy(\"sex\").count())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"0d14030f-1fd8-4c1e-8742-7ad7d2dea4d2","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Choose columns/features to do data balance analysis on\n","cols_of_interest = [\"race\", \"sex\"]\n","display(df.select(cols_of_interest + [label_col]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"ae54d20f-f04a-4ffd-a442-e995955d922e","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["### Calculate Feature Balance Measures\n","\n","Feature Balance Measures allow us to see whether each combination of sensitive feature is receiving the positive outcome (true prediction) at equal rates.\n","\n","In this context, we define a feature balance measure, also referred to as the parity, for label y as the absolute difference between the association metrics of two different sensitive classes \\\\([x_A, x_B]\\\\), with respect to the association metric \\\\(A(x_i, y)\\\\).
