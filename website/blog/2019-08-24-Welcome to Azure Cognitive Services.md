Integrating the power of Azure Cognitive Services into your big data workflows on Apache Sparkâ„¢
Today at Spark + AI Summit 2019, we're excited to introduce a new set of models in the SparkML ecosystem that make it easy to leverage the Azure Cognitive Services at terabyte scales. <!--truncate--> With only a few lines of code, developers can embed cognitive services within your existing distributed machine learning pipelines in Spark ML. Additionally, these contributions allow Spark users to chain or Pipeline services together with deep networks, gradient boosted trees, and any SparkML model and apply these hybrid models in elastic and serverless distributed systems.

From image recognition to object detection using speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech, Azure Cognitive Services makes it easy for developers to add intelligent capabilities to their applications in any scenario. To this date, more than a million developers have already discovered and tried Cognitive Services to accelerate breakthrough experiences in their application.
