If someone asked you what snow leopards and Vincent Van Gogh have in common, you might think it was the beginning of a joke. <!--truncate--> It’s not, but if it were, Mark Hamilton, a software engineer in Microsoft’s Cognitive Services group, budding PhD student and frequent Microsoft Research collaborator, would tell you the punchline is machine learning.
