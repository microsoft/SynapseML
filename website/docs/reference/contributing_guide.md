## Interested in contributing to SynapseML?  We're excited to work with you.

### You can contribute in many ways:

-   Use the library and give feedback: report bugs, request features.
-   Add sample Jupyter notebooks, Python or Scala code examples, documentation
    pages.
-   Fix bugs and issues.
-   Add new features, such as data transformations or machine learning algorithms.
-   Review pull requests from other contributors.

### How to contribute?

You can give feedback, report bugs and request new features anytime by opening
an issue.  Also, you can up-vote or comment on existing issues.

If you want to add code, examples or documentation to the repository, follow
this process:

#### Propose a contribution

-   Preferably, get started by tackling existing issues to get yourself acquainted
    with the library source and the process.
-   To ensure your contribution is a good fit and doesn't duplicate
    on-going work, open an issue or comment on an existing issue. In it, discuss
    your contribution and design.
-   Any algorithm you're planning to contribute should be well known and accepted
    for production use, and backed by research papers.
-   Algorithms should be highly scalable and suitable for massive datasets.
-   All contributions need to comply with the MIT License.  Contributors external
    to Microsoft need to sign CLA.

#### Implement your contribution

-   Fork the SynapseML repository.
-   Implement your algorithm in Scala, using our wrapper generation mechanism to
    produce PySpark bindings.
-   Use SparkML `PipelineStage`s so your algorithm can be used as a part of
    pipeline.
-   For parameters use `MMLParam`s.
-   Implement model saving and loading by extending SparkML `MLReadable`.
-   Use good Scala style.
-   Binary dependencies should be on Maven Central.
-   See this [pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/SynapseML/pull/22) for an
    example contribution.

#### Implement tests

-   Set up build environment.  Use a Linux machine or VM (we use Ubuntu, but other
    distros should work too).
-   Test your code locally.
-   Add tests using ScalaTests. Unit tests are required.
-   A sample notebook is required as an end-to-end test.

#### Implement documentation

-   Add a [sample Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/SynapseML/tree/master/notebooks) that shows the intended use
    case of your algorithm, with instructions in step-by-step manner.  (The same
    notebook could be used for testing the code.)
-   Add in-line ScalaDoc comments to your source code, to generate the [API
    reference documentation](https://mmlspark.azureedge.net/docs/pyspark/)

#### Open a pull request

-   In most cases, you should squash your commits into one.
-   Open a pull request, and link it to the discussion issue you created earlier.
-   A SynapseML core team member will trigger a build to test your changes.
-   Fix any build failures.  (The pull request will have comments from the build
    with useful links.)
-   Wait for code reviews from core team members and others.
-   Fix issues found in code review and reiterate.

#### Build and check-in

-   Wait for a core team member to merge your code in.
-   Your feature will be available through a Docker image and script installation
    in the next release, which typically happens around once a month.  You can try
    out your features sooner by using build artifacts for the version that has
    your changes merged in (such versions end with a `.devN`).

If in doubt about how to do something, see how it was done in existing code or
pull requests, and don't hesitate to ask.
