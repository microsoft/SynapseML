This input works by polling the `/channels/{channel_id}/messages` Discord API endpoint authenticated as a bot using token based authentication. The ID of the newest message consumed is stored in a cache in order to paginate results, ideally this cache should be persisted across restarts in order for the service to resume where it left off.

## Fields

### `channel_id`

A discord channel ID to consume messages from.


Type: `string`  

### `bot_token`

A bot token used for authentication.


Type: `string`  

### `poll_period`

Default: `"1m"`  

### `limit`

The maximum number of messages to receive in a single request.


Type: `int`  
Default: `100`  

### `cache`

A cache resource to use for request pagination, the ID of the last message received will be stored in this cache and used for subsequent requests.


Type: `string`  

### `cache_key`

The key identifier used when storing the ID of the last message received.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"last_message_id"`
