Dequeue objects from an Azure Storage Queue.

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- queue_storage_insertion_time
- queue_storage_queue_name
- queue_storage_message_lag (if 'track_properties' set to true)
- All user defined queue metadata
```

Only one authentication method is required, `storage_connection_string` or `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`. If both are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

## Fields

### `storage_account`

The storage account to dequeue messages from. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_sas_token`

The storage account SAS token. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` or `storage_access_key` are set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `queue_name`

The name of the target Storage queue.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `dequeue_visibility_timeout`

The timeout duration until a dequeued message gets visible again, 30s by default


Type: `string`  
Default: `"30s"`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of unprocessed messages to fetch at a given time.


Type: `int`  
Default: `10`  

### `track_properties`

If set to `true` the queue is polled on each read request for information such as the queue message lag. These properties are added to consumed messages as metadata, but will also have a negative performance impact.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
