A special broker type where the inputs are identified by unique labels and can
be created, changed and removed during runtime via a REST HTTP interface.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  dynamic:
    inputs: {}
    prefix: ""
    timeout: 5s
```

To GET a JSON map of input identifiers with their current uptimes use the
`/inputs` endpoint.

To perform CRUD actions on the inputs themselves use POST, DELETE, and GET
methods on the `/inputs/{input_id}` endpoint. When using POST the body
of the request should be a YAML configuration for the input, if the input
already exists it will be changed.
