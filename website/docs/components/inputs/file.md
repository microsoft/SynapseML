Consumes data from files on disk, emitting messages according to a chosen codec.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  file:
    paths: []
    codec: lines
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  file:
    paths: []
    codec: lines
    max_buffer: 1000000
    delete_on_finish: false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- path
```

You can access these metadata fields using
[function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#metadata).

## Fields

### `paths`

A list of paths to consume sequentially. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of a data source should be converted into discrete messages, codecs are useful for specifying how large files or contiunous streams of data might be processed in small chunks rather than loading it all in memory. It's possible to consume lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter. Codecs can be chained with `/`, for example a gzip compressed CSV file can be consumed with the codec `gzip/csv`.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"lines"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `auto` | EXPERIMENTAL: Attempts to derive a codec for each file based on information such as the extension. For example, a .tar.gz file would be consumed with the `gzip/tar` codec. Defaults to all-bytes. |
| `all-bytes` | Consume the entire file as a single binary message. |
| `chunker:x` | Consume the file in chunks of a given number of bytes. |
| `csv` | Consume structured rows as comma separated values, the first row must be a header row. |
| `delim:x` | Consume the file in segments divided by a custom delimiter. |
| `gzip` | Decompress a gzip file, this codec should precede another codec, e.g. `gzip/all-bytes`, `gzip/tar`, `gzip/csv`, etc. |
| `lines` | Consume the file in segments divided by linebreaks. |
| `multipart` | Consumes the output of another codec and batches messages together. A batch ends when an empty message is consumed. For example, the codec `lines/multipart` could be used to consume multipart messages where an empty line indicates the end of each batch. |
| `tar` | Parse the file as a tar archive, and consume each file of the archive as a message. |


```yaml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar

codec: gzip/csv
```

### `max_buffer`

The largest token size expected when consuming delimited files.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000000`  

### `delete_on_finish`

Whether to delete consumed files from the disk once they are fully consumed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

## Examples

<Tabs defaultValue="Read a Bunch of CSVs" values={[
{ label: 'Read a Bunch of CSVs', value: 'Read a Bunch of CSVs', },
]}>

<TabItem value="Read a Bunch of CSVs">

If we wished to consume a directory of CSV files as structured documents we can use a glob pattern and the `csv` codec:

```yaml
input:
  file:
    paths: [ ./data/*.csv ]
    codec: csv
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
