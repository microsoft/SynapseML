## Fields

### `url`

The URL of the target MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

url: mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### `database`

The name of the target MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `collection`

The name of the target collection in the MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `username`

The username to connect to the database.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `password`

The password to connect to the database.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `operation`

The mongodb operation to perform. Must be one of the following: insert-one, delete-one, delete-many, replace-one, update-one, find-one.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"insert"`  

### `write_concern`

The write_concern settings for the mongo connection.


Type: `object`  

### `write_concern.w`

W requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the specified number of mongodb instances.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `write_concern.j`

J requests acknowledgement from MongoDB that write operations are written to the journal.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `write_concern.w_timeout`

The write concern timeout.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `document_map`

A bloblang map representing the records in the mongo db. Used to generate the document for mongodb by mapping the fields in the message to the mongodb fields. The document map is required for the operations insert-one, replace-one and update-one.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

document_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `filter_map`

A bloblang map representing the filter for the mongo db command. The filter map is required for all operations except insert-one. It is used to find the document(s) for the operation. For example in a delete-one case, the filter map should have the fields required to locate the document to delete.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

filter_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `hint_map`

A bloblang map representing the hint for the mongo db command. This map is optional and is used with all operations except insert-one. It is used to improve performance of finding the documents in the mongodb.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

hint_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `parts`

An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `max_retries`

The maximum number of retries before giving up on the request. If set to zero there is no discrete limit.


Type: `int`  
Default: `3`  

### `backoff`

Control time intervals between retry attempts.


Type: `object`  

### `backoff.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

### `backoff.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `backoff.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum period to wait before retry attempts are abandoned. If zero then no limit is used.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"30s"`
