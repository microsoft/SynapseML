Do not buffer messages. This is the default and most resilient configuration.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
buffer:
  none: {}
```

Selecting no buffer means the output layer is directly coupled with the input
layer. This is the safest and lowest latency option since acknowledgements from
at-least-once protocols can be propagated all the way from the output protocol
to the input protocol.

If the output layer is hit with back pressure it will propagate all the way to
the input layer, and further up the data stream. If you need to relieve your
pipeline of this back pressure consider using a more robust buffering solution
such as Kafka before resorting to alternatives.
