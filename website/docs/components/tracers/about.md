A tracer type represents a destination for Benthos to send opentracing events to such as [Jaeger][jaeger].

When a tracer is configured all messages will be allocated a root span during ingestion that represents their journey through a Benthos pipeline. Many Benthos processors create spans, and so opentracing is a great way to analyse the pathways of individual messages as they progress through a Benthos instance.

Some inputs, such as `http_server` and `http_client`, are capable of extracting a root span from the source of the message (HTTP headers). This is
a work in progress and should eventually expand so that all inputs have a way of doing so.

A tracer config section looks like this:

```yaml
tracer:
  jaeger:
    agent_address: localhost:6831
    sampler_param: 1
    sampler_type: const
    service_name: benthos
```

WARNING: Although the configuration spec of this component is stable the format of spans, tags and logs created by Benthos is subject to change as it is tuned for improvement.
