:::warning DEPRECATED
This component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version release. Please consider moving onto [alternative components](#alternatives).
:::

Attempts to write messages to a child output and if the write fails for any
reason the message is dropped instead of being reattempted.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  drop_on_error: {}
```

## Alternatives

This output has been replaced with the more explicit and configurable [`drop_on`](/docs/components/outputs/drop_on) output.

This output can be combined with a child [`retry`](/docs/components/outputs/retry)
output in order to set an explicit number of retry attempts before dropping a
message.

For example, the following configuration attempts to send to a hypothetical
output type `foo` three times, but if all three attempts fail the
message is dropped entirely:

```yaml
output:
  drop_on_error:
    retry:
      max_retries: 2
      output:
        type: foo
```
