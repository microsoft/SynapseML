The kafka output type writes a batch of messages to Kafka brokers and waits for acknowledgement before propagating it back to the input.

The config field `ack_replicas` determines whether we wait for acknowledgement from all replicas or just a single broker.

Both the `key` and `topic` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

[Metadata](/docs/configuration/metadata) will be added to each message sent as headers, but can be restricted using the field [`metadata`](#metadata).

### Strict Ordering and Retries

When strict ordering is required for messages written to topic partitions it is important to ensure that both the field `max_in_flight` is set to `1` and that the field `retry_as_batch` is set to `true`.

You must also ensure that failed batches are never rerouted back to the same output. This can be done by setting the field `max_retries` to `0` and `backoff.max_elapsed_time` to empty, which will apply back pressure indefinitely until the batch is sent successfully.

However, this also means that manual intervention will eventually be required in cases where the batch cannot be sent due to configuration problems such as an incorrect `max_msg_bytes` estimate. A less strict but automated alternative would be to route failed batches to a dead letter queue using a [`try` broker](/docs/components/outputs/try), but this would allow subsequent batches to be delivered in the meantime whilst those failed batches are dealt with.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

### `sasl.token_key`

Required when using a `token_cache`, the key to query the cache with for tokens.


Type: `string`

Type: `string`  
Default: `""`

```yaml
# Examples

inject_tracing_map: meta = meta().merge(this)

Disabling this helps to reduce message duplicates during intermittent errors, but also makes it impossible to guarantee strict ordering of messages.

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yaml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
