Returns the logical XOR of children conditions, meaning it only resolves to
true if _exactly_ one of its children conditions resolves to true.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
xor: []
```

## Examples

The following snippet resolves to true if a message matches the resource
condition 'foo' or 'bar', but not both:

``` yaml
xor:
  - resource: foo
  - resource: bar
```
