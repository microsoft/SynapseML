Executes a [Bloblang](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) query on messages, expecting
a boolean result. If the result of the query is true then the condition passes,
otherwise it does not.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
bloblang: ""
```

## Examples

With the following config:

``` yaml
bloblang: a == "foo"
```

A message `{"a":"foo"}` would pass, but
`{"a":"bar"}` would not.
