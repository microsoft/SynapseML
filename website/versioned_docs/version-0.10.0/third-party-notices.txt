Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
------------------------------------

"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the
WebM codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.

Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed."

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any
   bugs, please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to
   pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is
provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its
quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2013, Thomas G. Lane, Guido
Vollbeding.  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
    then this README file must be included, with this copyright and
    no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or
    changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in
    accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
    documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
    work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
    accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
    authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you
ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or
products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the
Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability
claims are assumed by the product vendor.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
Autoconf.  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
distributable.  The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is
copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are
readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."
