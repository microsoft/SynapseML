# SynapseML

SynapseML is an ecosystem of tools aimed towards expanding the distributed computing framework
[Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) in several new directions.
SynapseML adds many deep learning and data science tools to the Spark ecosystem,
including seamless integration of Spark Machine Learning pipelines with [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit
(CNTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) and
[OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org/). These tools enable powerful and highly-scalable predictive and analytical models
for a variety of datasources.

SynapseML also brings new networking capabilities to the Spark Ecosystem. With the HTTP on Spark project, users
can embed **any** web service into their SparkML models. In this vein, SynapseML provides easy to use
SparkML transformers for a wide variety of [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). For production grade deployment, the Spark Serving project enables high throughput,
sub-millisecond latency web services, backed by your Spark cluster.

SynapseML requires Scala 2.12, Spark 3.0+, and Python 3.6+.
See the API documentation [for
Scala](https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/docs/0.9.5/scala/index.html#package) and [for
PySpark](https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/docs/0.9.5/pyspark/index.html).
