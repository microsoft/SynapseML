A fast vector assembler.  The columns given must be ordered such that
categorical columns come first.  Otherwise, Spark learners will give
categorical attributes to the wrong index.  The assembler does not keep
spurious numeric data which can significantly slow down computations
when there are millions of columns.

To use this ``FastVectorAssemble`` you must import the
``org.apache.spark.ml.feature`` package.
