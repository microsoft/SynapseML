We introduce an Apache Spark-based micro-service orchestration \x3c!--truncate--\x3e framework that extends database operations to include web service primitives. Our system can orchestrate web services across hundreds of machines and takes full advantage of cluster, thread, and asynchronous parallelism. Using this framework, we provide large scale clients for intelligent services such as speech, vision, search, anomaly detection, and text analysis. This allows users to integrate ready-to-use intelligence into any datastore with an Apache Spark connector. To eliminate the majority of overhead from network communication, we also introduce a low-latency containerized version of our architecture. Finally, we demonstrate that the services we investigate are competitive on a variety of benchmarks, and present two applications of this framework to create intelligent search engines, and real time auto race analytics systems.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/large-scale-services/)"},{"id":"Overview","metadata":{"permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/overview","source":"@site/blog/overview.md","title":"Overview","description":"SynapseML Overview","date":"2021-10-25T06:40:39.328Z","formattedDate":"October 25, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.66,"truncated":true,"authors":[],"prevItem":{"title":"Publication - Large-Scale Intelligent Microservices","permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/2020-12-Large-Scale Intelligent Microservices"},"nextItem":{"title":"MMLSpark: empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/2019/10/02/MMLSpark empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton"}},"content":"Synapse Machine Learning expands the distributed computing framework [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) in several new directions.
