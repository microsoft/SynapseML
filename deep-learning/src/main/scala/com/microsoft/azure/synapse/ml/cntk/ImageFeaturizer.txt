The ``ImageFeaturizer`` relies on a ``CNTKModel`` to do the
featurization of the image(s).  One can set this model using the
modelLocation parameter.  To map the nodes of the ``CNTKModel`` onto the
standard "layers" structure of a feed forward neural net, one needs to
supply a list of node names that range from the output node, back
towards the input node of the CNTK Function.  This list does not need to
be exhaustive, and is provided to you if you use a model downloaded
from ``ModelDownloader``.  One can find this layer list in the schema
of the downloaded model.

The ``ImageFeaturizer`` takes an input column of images (the type
returned by the ``ImageReader``), automatically resizes them to fit the
``CNTKModel``'s inputs, and feeds them through a pre-trained CNTK model.
One can truncate the model using the ``cutOutputLayers`` parameter that
determines how many layers to truncate from the output of the network.
For example, layer=0 means that no layers are removed, layer=2 means
that the ``ImageFeaturizer`` returns the activations of the layer that
is two layers from the output layer, and so on.
