The ``CNTKModel`` evaluates a pre-trained CNTK model in parallel.  The
``CNTKModel`` takes a path to a model and automatically loads and
distributes the model to workers for parallel evaluation using CNTK's
java bindings.

The ``CNTKModel`` loads the pretrained model into the ``Function`` class
of CNTK.  One can decide which node of the CNTK Function computation
graph to evaluate by passing in the name of the output node with the
output node parameter.  Currently the ``CNTKModel`` supports single
input single output models.

The ``CNTKModel`` takes an input column which should be a column of
spark vectors and returns a column of spark vectors representing the
activations of the selected node.  By default, the CNTK model defaults
to using the model's first input and first output node.
