name: Clean ACR

# Notes: To access key vault and grab the connection string, we first need a service principal.
# We need to add that service principal as a Reader in the RBAC for the key vault in question,
# as well as adding it with Get and List permissions in the key vault's access policies.
# Then we need to store that service principal's info as a GitHub secret.
# We then use that secret here as the credentials for logging into Azure.
# Instructions are here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/github-key-vault
# In our case, the service principal is called synapseml-clean-acr.
# The github secret is a repository secret called clean_acr.
# It is backed up in the mmlspark-keys vault by secret clean-acr-github-actions-info.
# The secret has an expiration date (currently 11/20/2024), so it will need to be renewed at some point.

# normal usage
#on:
#  schedule:
#    - cron: "0 1 * * 0" # every sunday at 1am

# use this for debugging; you can trigger the workflow in the 'Actions' tab in github.
# Apparently, this file be in the master branch to get the 'Run workflow' button.
