Related to parkour. The donor is Zach Sharity NAFTA. We hit the Red Bull out of motion in Santorini. It's Beautiful Island in Greece and the structure here. The architecture is just amazing. It's basically built for parkour and freerunning. Yes, this is a amazing. You can just work in every direction and you find the awesomer. And it's so fun. I hope people will come here and have a look at this because this is just one of the most beautiful places I've been so far.
