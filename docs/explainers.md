# Model Interpretation on Spark

## Interpretable Machine Learning

Interpretable Machine Learning helps developers, data scientists and business stakeholders in the organization gain a comprehensive understanding of their machine learning models. It can also be used to debug models, explain predictions and enable auditing to meet compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Why run model interpretation on Spark

Model-agnostic interpretation methods can be computationally expensive due to the multiple evaluations needed to compute the explanations. Model interpretation on Spark enables users to interpret a black-box model at massive scales with the Apache Sparkâ„¢ distributed computing ecosystem. Various components support local interpretation for tabular, vector, image and text classification models, with two popular model-agnostic interpretation methods: [LIME] and [Kernel SHAP].

[LIME]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938

[Kernel SHAP]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874

## Usage

Both LIME and Kernel SHAP are local interpretation methods. Local interpretation explains why does the model predict certain outcome for a given observation.

Both explainers extends from `org.apache.spark.ml.Transformer`. After setting up the explainer parameters, simply call the `transform` function on a `DataFrame` of observations to interpret the model behavior on these observations.

To see examples of model interpretability on Spark in action, take a look at these sample notebooks:

## Result interpretation

### LIME explainers

LIME explainers return an array of vectors, and each vector maps to a class being explained. Each component of the vector is the coefficient for the corresponding feature, super-pixel, or word token from the local surrogate model.

- For categorical variables, super-pixels, or word tokens, the coefficient shows the average change in model outcome if this feature is unknown to the model, if the super-pixel is replaced with background color (black), or if the word token is replaced with empty string.
- For numeric variables, the coefficient shows the change in model outcome if the feature value is incremented by 1 unit.

### SHAP explainers

SHAP explainers return an array of vectors, and each vector maps to a class being explained. Each vector starts with the [base value](#base-value), and each following component of the vector is the Shapley value for each feature, super-pixel, or token.

The base value and Shapley values are additive, and they should add up to the model output for the target observation.

#### Base value

- For tabular and vector models, the base value represents the mean outcome of the model for the background dataset.
- For image models, the base value represents the model outcome for a background (all black) image.
- For text models, the base value represents the model outcome for an empty string.
