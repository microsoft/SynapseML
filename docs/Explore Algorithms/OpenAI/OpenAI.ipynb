        "The Azure OpenAI service can be used to solve a large number of natural language tasks through prompting the completion API. To make it easier to scale your prompting workflows from a few examples to large datasets of examples, we have integrated the Azure OpenAI service with the distributed machine learning library [SynapseML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/synapseml-a-simple-multilingual-and-massively-parallel-machine-learning-library/). This integration makes it easy to use the [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) distributed computing framework to process millions of prompts with the OpenAI service. This tutorial shows how to apply large language models at a distributed scale using Azure OpenAI. "
