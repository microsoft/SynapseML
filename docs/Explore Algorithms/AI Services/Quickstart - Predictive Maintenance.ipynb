    "\n",
    "This recipe shows how you can use Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure AI services on Apache Spark for predictive maintenance of IoT devices. We'll follow along with the [CosmosDB and Synapse Link](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cosmosdb-synapse-link-samples) sample. To keep things simple, in this recipe we'll read the data straight from a CSV file rather than getting streamed data through CosmosDB and Synapse Link. We strongly encourage you to look over the Synapse Link sample."
