    "# Hyperparameter tuning: SynapseML with Hyperopt\n",
    "\n",
    "[SynapseML](https://github.com/microsoft/SynapseML) is an open-source library that simplifies the creation of massively scalable machine learning (ML) pipelines. SynapseML provides simple, composable, and distributed APIs for a wide variety of different machine learning tasks such as text analytics, vision, anomaly detection, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt), on the other hand, is a Python library for serial and parallel optimization over complex search spaces, including real-valued, discrete, and conditional dimensions.\n",

    "This guide showcases the process of tuning a distributed algorithm in Spark with SynapseML and Hyperopt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use case of this guide is for distributed machine learning in Python that requires hyperparameter tuning. It provides a demo on how to tune hyperparameters for a machine learning workflow in SynapseML and can be used as a reference to tune other distributed machine learning algorithms from Spark MLlib or other libraries.\n",
