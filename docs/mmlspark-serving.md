### An Engine for Deploying Spark Jobs as Distributed Web Services

-   **Distributed**: Takes full advantage of Node, JVM, and thread level
    parallelism that Spark is famous for.
-   **Fast**: No single node bottlenecks, no round trips to Python.
    Requests can be routed directly to and from worker JVMs through
    network switches.  Spin up a web service in a matter of seconds. 
-   **Low Latency**: When using continuous serving,
    you can achieve latencies as low as 1 millisecond.
-   **Deployable Anywhere**: Works anywhere that runs Spark such as
    Databricks, HDInsight, AZTK, DSVMs, local, or on your own
    cluster.  Usable from Spark, PySpark, and SparklyR.
-   **Lightweight**: No dependence on additional (costly) Kafka or
    Kubernetes clusters.
-   **Idiomatic**: Uses the same API as batch and structured streaming.
-   **Flexible**: Spin up and manage several services on a single Spark
    cluster.  Synchronous and Asynchronous service management and
    extensibility.  Deploy any spark job that is expressible as a
    structured streaming query.  Use serving sources/sinks with other
    Spark data sources/sinks for more complex deployments.

### Spark Serving Hello World

```python
import mmlspark
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, length
from pyspark.sql.types import *

df = spark.readStream.server() \
    .address("localhost", 8888, "my_api") \
    .load() \
    .parseRequest(StructType().add("foo", StringType()).add("bar", IntegerType()))

replies = df.withColumn("fooLength", length(col("foo")))\
    .makeReply("fooLength") 

server = replies\
    .writeStream \
    .server() \
    .replyTo("my_api") \
    .queryName("my_query") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "file:///path/to/checkpoints") \
    .start()
```

from mmlspark.cntk import CNTKModel
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col

df = spark.readStream.server() \
       .address("localhost", 8888, "my_api")
       .load()
       .parseRequest(<Insert your models input schema here>)

# See notebook examples for how to create and save several
# examples of CNTK models
network = CNTKModel.load("file:///path/to/my_cntkmodel.mml")

transformed_df = network.transform(df).makeReply(<Whatever column you wish to send back>)

server = transformed_df \
           .writeStream \
           .server() \
           .replyTo("my_api") \
           .queryName("my_query") \
           .option("checkpointLocation", "file:///path/to/checkpoints") \
           .start()
```

## Architecture

Spark Serving adds special streaming sources sinks to turn any
structured streaming job into a web service.  Spark Serving comes
with two deployment options that vary based on the load balancing used:

In brief you can use the following:
`spark.readStream.server()`: For head node load balanced services
`spark.readStream.distributedServer()`: For custom load balanced services
`spark.readStream.continuousServer()`: For a custom load balanced, sub-millisecond latency continuous server

To create the various different serving dataframes and use the equivalent statements after `df.writeStream` 
for replying to the web requests

### Head Node Load Balanced

You can deploy head node load balancing with the `HTTPSource` and
`HTTPSink` classes.  This mode spins up a queue on the head node,
distributes work across partitions, then collects response data back to
the head node.  All HTTP requests are kept and replied to on the head
node. In both python and Scala these classes can be access by using 
`spark.readStream.server()` after importing MMLSpark.
This mode allows for more complex windowing, repartitioning, and
SQL operations.  This option is also idea for rapid setup and testing,
as it doesn't require any additional load balancing or network
switches.A diagram of this configuration can be seen below:

</p>

### Fully Distributed (Custom Load Balancer)

You can configure Spark Serving for a custom load balancer using the
`DistributedHTTPSource` and `DistributedHTTPSink` classes.  This mode
spins up servers on each executor JVM.  
In both python and Scala these classes can be access by using 
`spark.readStream.distributedServer()` after importing MMLSpark.
Each server will feed its
executor's partitions in parallel.  This mode is key for high throughput
and low latency as data does not need to be transferred to and from the
head node.  This deployment results in several web services that all
route into the same spark computation.  You can deploy an external load
balancer to unify the executor's services under a single IP address.
Support for automatic load balancer management and deployment is
targeted for the next release of MMLSpark.  A diagram of this
configuration can be seen below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/graphics/FullyDistributed2.png" width="600">
</p>

Queries that involve data movement across workers, such as a nontrivial
SQL join, need special consideration.  The user must ensure that the
right machine replies to each request.  One can route data back to the
originating partition with a broadcast join.  In the future, request
routing will be automatically handled by the sink.

### Sub-Millisecond Latency with Continuous Processing

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/graphics/Readme/latency_comparison.png" width="600">
</p>

Continuous processing can be enabled by hooking into the `HTTPSourceV2` class using:

    spark.readStream.continuousServer()
      ...

Note that in continuous serving, much like continuous streaming you need to add a trigger to your write statement:

     df.writeStream
      .continuousServer()
      .trigger(continuous="1 second")
      ...

The architecture is very similiar to the custom load balancer setup described above.
More specifically, Spark will manage a web service on each partition. 
These webservices can be unified together using an Azure Load Balancer, 
Kubernetes Service Endpoint, Azure Application gateway or any other way to load balance a distributed service.
It is currently the user's responsibility to optionally unify these services as they see fit. 
In the furutre we will include options to dynamically spin up and manage a load balancer.

#### Databricks Setup

Databricks is a managed architecture and they have restricted
all incoming traffic to the nodes of the cluster. 
If you create a web service in your databricks cluster (head or worker nodes),
your cluster can communicate with the service, but the outside world cannot.
However, In the future, Databricks will support Virtual Network Injection so this will not be a problem. 
In the meantime, you must use SSH tunneling to forward the services to another machine(s)
to act as a networking gateway. This machine can be any machine that accpets SSH traffic and requests.
We have included settings to automatically configure this SSH tunneling for convenience.

##### Linux Gateway Setup - Azure

1.  [Create a Linux VM using SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal)
2.  [Open ports 8000-9999 from the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/nsg-quickstart-portal)
3.  Open the port on the firewall on the VM
    ```$xslt
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8000-10000/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload
    echo "GatewayPorts yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    service ssh --full-restart
    ```
4.  Add your private key to a private container in [Azure Storage Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=portal).
5.  Generate a SAS link for your key and save it.
6.  Simply include the following parameters on your reader to configure the SSH tunneling:
        serving_inputs = (spark.readStream.continuousServer()
          .option("numPartitions", 1)
          .option("forwarding.enabled", True)  # enable ssh forwarding to a gateway machine
          .option("forwarding.username", "username")
          .option("forwarding.sshHost", "ip or dns")
          .option("forwarding.keySas", "SAS url from the previous step")
          .address("localhost", 8904, "my_api")
          .load() 

Note that this will make your service require an extra jump and affect latency. 
It is important to pick a gateway that has good connectivity to your spark cluster.
For this reason we suggest using Spark Serving 
on a cluster enviromnent that is more open such as Kubernetes, Mesos, or Azure Batch
for best performance and ease of configuration.
